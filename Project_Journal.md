that should be the model1 of a high level overview on how it is going to work.
setting up techniques would mean i want to use flask application for this and then use git pages or railways for hosting.
okay lets begin then.

just set up my basic outlook the first deployment 
-using railways for development
this is how the first look of the website is

alright now lets start editing this html file to curate it to the login page

the frame work should be something like this

and then adding an image to that it should look a bit better so

that should now let me add in fileds for user to sgin-in/log-in enter mail and password should be fine.

okay now lets begin with the next page i am thinking of a simple page with two options one would be sign-in if the user isn't identified then take user to the new login page
-user email
-password
if already known
if new 
-user email
-password
-confirm password

that should be my current standing now i will go to the models section to start working on the database maintainance so i can assign each user their own instance and yeah maintain overall transparacny for
-data storage
-user validation
-new registration

added a databse checks are looking good now i can go ahead to develop the application in this increment now it looks like i would have to implement user aspects and how the landing page looks like etc eeha.
still a bit rough flash images though so got to work on that gui to so.

okay the first level building is done with some rough edges though now second stage plan ahs to thought out.
